Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+

Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
select customers.name as 'Customers'
from customers
where customers.id not in
(
    select customerid from orders
);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given three tables: salesperson, company, orders.
Output all the names in the table salesperson, who didnâ€™t have sales to company 'RED'.

Example
Input

Table: salesperson

+----------+------+--------+-----------------+-----------+

| 4        |   4/1/2014 |    1    |    4     | 25000  |
+----------+----------+---------+----------+--------+
The table orders holds the sales record information, salesperson and customer company are represented by sales_id and com_id.
output

+------+
| name |
+------+
| Amy  |
| Mark |
| Alex |
+------+

select name
from salesperson
where sales_id not in (
select sales_id
from company c join orders o on c.com_id = o.com_id
where name = 'RED'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a query to print the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (TIV_2016), to a scale of 2 decimal places, for
all policy holders who meet the following criteria:

    Have the same TIV_2015 value as one or more other policyholders.
    Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude, longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).

Input Format:
The insurance table is described as follows:

| Column Name | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| PID         | INTEGER(11)   |
| TIV_2015    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| TIV_2016    | NUMERIC(15,2) |
| LAT         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |
| LON         | NUMERIC(5,2)  |

where PID is the policyholder's policy ID, TIV_2015 is the total investment value in 2015, TIV_2016 is the total
investment value in 2016, LAT is the latitude of the policy holder's city, and LON is the longitude of the policy holder's city.

Sample Input

| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |

Sample Output

| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |
Explanation

The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The TIV_2015 value '10' is as the same as the third and forth record, and its location unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its TIV_2015 is not like any other policyholders.

And its location is the same with the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.

So, the result is the sum of TIV_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.


SELECT
    SUM(insurance.TIV_2016) AS TIV_2016
FROM
    insurance
WHERE
    insurance.TIV_2015 IN
    (
      SELECT
        TIV_2015
      FROM
        insurance
      GROUP BY TIV_2015
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    )
    AND CONCAT(LAT, LON) IN
    (
      SELECT
        CONCAT(LAT, LON)
      FROM
        insurance
      GROUP BY LAT , LON
      HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
    )
